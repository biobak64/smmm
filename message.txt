The closest point of comparison to these messages would be our irl long-term nuclear storage warning proposals, something left behind and broadly interpretable by anyone stumbling upon them. It's meant to be written in imposing and direct terminology.

**Entry 1**
Introduction to the (let's call them culture A). They introduce themselves collectively, and explain that Agamemnon has sought them out to use their technology as its own (to upgrade itself, so to speak.) the entry ends declaring that the reader is tasked with maintaining the technological upgrades they left behind.

**Entry 2**
This entry simply explains that the inner mechanical structure of Agamemnon makes use of Type-II technology, and that the outer layer much less complex and far easier to repair.

Whenever you see "Type I" or "Type II" mentioned, they are referencing the *Kardashev scale*.

**Entry 3**
This entry explains that a substance known as quasilight ("Something resembling light, not sure if the quasi- prefix exists in french as well") is being ejected from Agamemnon at all times, and that it's created by ribosomes (referencing the cellular organ) which are in turn responsible for creating cosmic seeds. The latter half of the entry explains that DELTA-class organisms (classification entirely made up for purposes of BTCM) should not in any circumstances come in contant with the beam, as they would die instantly (as happens in game).

**entry 4**
This entry described the person which would be able to assume the role of maintenance of Agamemnon, laying down criteria which fit the Showrunner.
 that culture A's Prophet, someone only known as the "Architect" were to disappear, another person may take their place: Be it another prophet, or someone appointed by a prophet. It's specified that they must be from a Type-II civilization, or a civilizaton which has developed ionosphere communications (Earth fits into this category, as we have managed to develop the radio).

**Entry 5**
This described how "the cell" (Agamemnon, as it's a single celled organism) always assumes it's directive (not specified, but the only reason Agamemnon exists is to feed on living beings' attention and exist continuously).
The entry explains how the maintainer is allowed to introduce external organelles (anything which would let Agamemnon interface with the outside world) is permitted.
It mentions that digging through the crust (the rocky layer surrounding the cell) is permitted, although anything directly interfering with the nucleus of the cell is not allowed.

**Entry 6**
This entry refers to something called "The Screen" project, seemingly created by culture A. It refers to the gigantic eye which is always visible on Agamemnon. 
It explains how the majority of living creatures see it as non-treathening, and, as such, it increased the ability of the cosmic seed to find valid candidates (Those who could become prophets).

**Entry 7**
This entry just explains how Agamemnon has a nervous system can use mechanical equipment.

**Entry 8**
This entry elaborates, explaning how Cosmic Seeds can do the same thing, and essentialy act as extensions of Agamemnon in that regard.

**entry 9**
This entry introduces the concept of signals being sent through the Agamemnon nervous system - it passing the idea of the "Screen" to the cosmic seeds, explaining how we see monitor enemies.

This entry also introduces the concept of a timer, stating that once agamemnon reaches over 6500 km in diamater (becomes bigger than the earth), the writer orders the reader to try to let Agamemnon process information using the neural network, essentialy letting it act as a biological computer.

**entry 10**
This entry explains that Cosmic Seeds can take data from the Agamemnon nervous system, and use it to alter their hosts - leading to mutations, as seen with the Showrunner.

**entry 11**
This entry simply elaborates on the process, saying that cosmic seeds find it easier to fit onto technology which uses the screen, as well as "The screen" manifesting more frequently on docile creatures.

**entry 12**
This entry introduces the PALAMEDES project. the PALAMEDES project is an experiment which turns creatures into the kind of entity you see defending the final boss. It mentions how only DELTA class organisms are qualified.

They are introduces as a sort of "Defensive measure" that the moon has, and that earth is not considered advanced enough for them to consider the planet a threat.

**entry 13**
This explains the hierarchy shown between the (EXECUTIVE > SHOWRUNNER > His Underlings).

Agamemnon first seeks out an avatar (Executive), something to exist in its image on the planet, and the avatar then seeks out a prophet (Showrunner), who promotes the avatar and spreads cosmic seeds to as many entities as possible.

This entry explains how PALAMEDES are to invade a given world if this mechanism is no longer functioning.

**entry 14**
This entry reveals the whole point of Agamemnon - it's a being which feeds off of attention. 
it  also mentions that Avatars exist as proxies which help gather the attention.

It continues explaining that avatars can exist in many forms - digital, conceptual - not necessarily physical - and should assume the role which would garner the most attention from their given society.
**entry 15**
The entry also mentions that PALAMEDES are to invade a world if both the prophet (showrunner) and avatar (executive) are gone on a given world, meaning that if Agamemnon isn't defeated the world is not going to last long.

**entry 16**
This is an entry written by the Showrunner. It explains how members of culture A got turned into instances of PALAMEDES when the moon learned to run the lab by itself.

It explains that Showrunner was physically unable to fight against mario due to the cosmic seed, but that in the case of his defeat, he left a "showrunner special" (rocket boots) inside the nucleus room to help us out.
